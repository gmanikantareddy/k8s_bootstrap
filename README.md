# AWS Kubernetes Cluster Setup

This script automates the setup of a Kubernetes cluster on AWS using EC2 instances with Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. It creates one master node and multiple worker nodes, configuring them with containerd as the container runtime and Calico as the network plugin.

You may choose either python or terraform to deploy the cluster. Please check inside the respective directories for further steps.
